R8This is a movie and game review website based on an X/8 rating scale and allows users to comment and leave their own ratings on today's most popular entertainment. Users can customize their profiles and save a list of their favorite movies and games and recieve recommendations based on them. R8This was designed to be stylish, silly, and themed after the humble Octopus, our favorite 8 legged cephalopod.
